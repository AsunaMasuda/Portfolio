# Asuna Masuda Portfolio
Milestone Project #1 : User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio shows my career and education histories and highlights my skills and several projects that cover a wide range of technologies in software development and data science. Also, it contains a contact form for the visiters who are interested in contacting me.

## Demo
[Live demo](https://asunamasuda.github.io/Portfolio/) is available here.

### UX Strategy

#### Structure
- Utilized a responsive navigation bar which makes it easy to navigate and recognize where the visiters are in the site. This navbar collapses with smaller screen sizes, so the navbar section does not get busy with letters.
- The footer section holds icons and links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts

#### Design
- Chose moderate and beautiful backgrounds.
- Unified the colors using blue, yellow and pink with darker tones.
- When hover over any links, they returns yellow color so that they can unify the site.

#### Contents
- Kept the words as simple as possible as I wanted the visiters easily to glimpse of who I am  
- Visualized the skills with the filled & unfilled stars so they can easily grasp my skills at a glance

#### Wireframes

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.4.1)

## Features Left to Implement
- At the moment, submit botton just replies in a alert message. In the future, I'd like to connect with my email address so I can receive. 
- More animations when hovering over some parts of the site with JavaScript. E.g. the stars in the skill section could respond

## Testing

## Deployment
This site is using a custom domain with GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will be updated upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
